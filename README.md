## Homework 1: Due 2022.09.05 

This week we have a written part and an implementation part. 

### Written part 

Answer the questions found in `main.tex` and turn your answers in by uploading them 
back here before midnight on the due date. You may do this as many times as 
you want. Only your final submission counts.

Remember this is math class so be sure to justify your answers. You will be 
graded on correctness and 

Note: when you submit, your filename must be `solutions.pdf` and it must be a pdf. 

(Hint: an adapted solution to the implementation could help you answer some 
of the questions...)

### Implementation part 

Make `cipher.go` work. There are more detailed instructions in the comments.

(Hint: characters are secretly just numbers via ASCII encodings. Use that 
to make your life easier. Or don't)

Bonus points: create `better_cipher.go` and have it (maybe)
- prompt the user for the desired shift
- use a custom substition table 
- check if a phrase is encoded via Caesar cipher 
- properly sanitize the user input
